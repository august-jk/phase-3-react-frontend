# Sinatra/React Phase 3 Project

Hello and welcome to my phase 3 project!

This Project showcases a sinatra backend and react frontend.

All of the included data has been seeded.

## About the Application

Here you will see a list of games and their related reviews.

In the backend, which will be linked at the bottom, you will see that I have 2 models with a one-to-many relationship: each game has many reviews and each review belongs to a game.

## Add New Games 
If you click on the Add New Game tab from the Navbar, you can create new game instances.

These new instances will pop up on the bottom of the Game Reviews page.

## Game Reviews

On the Game Reviews page, you can see a list of all of the games that have been added.

Each game has a title, genre, platform, price, and average score.

There are also two buttons on each game "card" which are labeled Show Reviews and Review Game. Clicking on either of these will show the reviews or create a new review, respectively.

## Show Reviews

Each game has a list of reviews, once you click on the Show Reviews button on the game "card", the list of reviews will appear.

## Create Review

You can create new reviews for each game. Just click on the Review Game button at the bottom of the game "card" to add a review to the game.

Each review consists of the reviewer's name, the score they are giving the game, and their comment.

(Note: depending on the scores of the reviews, the average score on the game "card" will adjust to reflect the average)

## Edit and Delete Reviews

On each review there are two buttons, the ‚ùå and ‚úèÔ∏è.

If you click on the ‚ùå button, the review will be deleted.

If you click on the ‚úèÔ∏è button, you can edit the score and comment on the review. Just click the üíæ button once you're done to save the changes made to the review.
